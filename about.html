                <h1>Bio</h1>

<p>1992-2016</p>
<p>I was born in 1992 in my hometown, Kerman, Iran, where I lived there until 2016.</p> 

<p>2016-2021

In 2016, I completed my Master’s in Pure Mathematics and with my husband we moved to Paris. Living there was a distinctive experience; the city’s rich culture and art quietly reignited my interest in painting and drawing. I began to reconnect with art through experiments with oil paints, coloured pencils, and pastels. In 2019, I decided to return to mathematics and began a Master’s in Applied Mathematics at Sorbonne University. 

2021-2024

 I moved to Vienna in 2021 and has to continue the master's programme online, alongside remote course in drawing. Drawn ever deeper into the world of art, I eventually chose to leave the Master’s behind and devote myself fully to painting—seeking to explore my artistic strengths beyond materials and media. I further refined my skills by taking  online  courses in art. I have also spent one year working under the supervision of Hessam Samavatian.

2024-2025
I have been based in Gdańsk, Poland.

2025-now
I have been based in Warsaw.



Despite moving between several places in a relatively short time, I’ve always felt a deep sense of homesickness—of being apart from my motherland, and especially from my family. This feeling has profoundly shaped my artwork. I paint to remember, to hold on to memories. Even I, myself, have become a daily subject—whether in the mirror or reflected in the television screen. I am one of the many figures in my paintings I live alongside.
