                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Born in 12 July 1992, the artist <strong>Fateme Samare Hedayatzade</strong> grew up in <strong>Kerman, Iran</strong>, where she also completed her master's degree in pure mathematics.</p>
                <p>In 2016, she then moved to <strong>Paris</strong> with her husband, where, influenced by Parisian art and culture, she began painting and experimenting with various media, including <em>oil paints, coloured pencils, and pastels</em>.</p>
                <p>In 2019, she pursued a master's degree in applied mathematics. In 2021, she moved to <strong>Vienna</strong>, continued her studies remotely, and enrolled in an online drawing course.</p>
                <p>Deeply inspired by the world of art, she dedicated herself entirely to painting, leaving her master's program to explore her artistic strengths beyond just materials and media.</p>
                <p>She further refined her skills through three online art courses and by working under the supervision of an artist, receiving valuable feedback and learning about <strong>art history</strong>.</p>
